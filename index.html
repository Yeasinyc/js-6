            The economy of Bangladesh is a major developing market economy.[42] As the second-largest economy in South Asia,[43][44] Bangladesh's economy is the 35th largest in the world in nominal terms, and 25th largest by purchasing power parity. Bangladesh is seen by various financial institutions as one of the Next Eleven. It has been transitioning from being a frontier market into an emerging market. Bangladesh is a member of the South Asian Free Trade Area and the World Trade Organization. In fiscal year 2021–2022, Bangladesh registered a GDP growth rate of 7.2% after the global pandemic.[45] Bangladesh is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.

Industrialisation in Bangladesh received a strong impetus after the partition of India due to labour reforms and new industries.[46] Between 1947 and 1971, East Bengal generated between 70% and 50% of Pakistan's exports.[47][48] Modern Bangladesh embarked on economic reforms in the late 1970s which promoted free markets and foreign direct investment. By the 1990s, the country had a booming ready-made garments industry. As of 16 March 2024, Bangladesh has the highest number of green garment factories in the world with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), where 80 are platinum-rated, 119 are gold-rated, 10 are silver, and four are without any rating.[49] As of 06 March 2024, Bangladesh is home to 54 of the top 100 LEED Green Garment Factories globally, including 9 out of the top 10, and 18 out of the top 20.[50] As of 27 April 2024, Bangladesh has a growing pharmaceutical industry with 12 percent average annual growth rate. Bangladesh is the only nation among the 48 least-developed countries that is almost self-sufficient when it comes to medicine production as local companies meet 98 percent of the domestic demand for pharmaceuticals.[51] Remittances from the large Bangladeshi diaspora became a vital source of foreign exchange reserves.[52] Agriculture in Bangladesh is supported by government subsidies and ensures self-sufficiency in food production.[53][54] Bangladesh has pursued export-oriented industrialisation.[55][56]

Bangladesh experienced robust growth after the pandemic with macroeconomic stability, improvements in infrastructure, a growing digital economy, and growing trade flows.[57] Tax collection remains very low, with tax revenues accounting for only 7.7% of GDP.[58] Bangladesh's banking sector has a large amount of non-performing loans or loan defaults, which have caused a lot of concern.[58][59] The private sector makes up 80% of GDP.[60][61] The Dhaka Stock Exchange and Chittagong Stock Exchange are the two stock markets of the country.[62] Most Bangladeshi businesses are privately owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) which make up 90% of all businesses.[63]

        The partition of India changed the economic geography of the region. The Pakistani government in East Bengal prioritized industries based on local raw materials like jute, cotton, and leather. The Korean War drove up demand for jute products.[89] Adamjee Jute Mills, the world's largest jute processing plant, was built in the Port of Narayanganj. The plant was a symbol of East Pakistan's industrialization. Living standards began to gradually improve. Labor reforms in 1958 eventually benefitted a future independent Bangladesh to develop industry.[46] Free market principles were generally accepted. The government promoted an industrial policy which aimed to produce consumer goods as quickly as possible in order to avoid dependence on imports. Certain sectors, like public utilities, fell under state ownership.[90] Natural gas in Sylhet was discovered by the Burmah Oil Company in 1955.[91] By the late 1960s, East Pakistan's share of Pakistan's exports went down from 70% to 50%.[47] Pakistan's rulers launched a so-called "Decade of Development" that "resulted in numerous economic and social contradictions, which played themselves out, not just in the 1960s, but beyond, where Ayub Khan’s rule created the social and economic conditions leading to the separation of East Pakistan".[92] According to the World Bank, economic discrimination against East Pakistan included diverting foreign aid and other funds to West Pakistan, the use of East Pakistan's foreign-exchange surpluses to finance West Pakistani imports, and refusal by the central government to release funds allocated to East Pakistan.[93] Rehman Sobhan paraphrased the Two-Nation Theory into the Two Economies Theory by arguing that East and West Pakistan diverged and became two different economies within one country
